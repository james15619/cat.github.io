				<h2>Persian cat</h2>
				<p>The Persian cat (Persian: گربه ایرانی Gorbe Irâni) is a long-haired breed of cat characterized by its round face and short muzzle. It is also known as the Persian Longhair. In the Middle East they are widely known as Iranian cat and in Iran they are known as Shirazi cat. The first documented ancestors of the Persian were imported into Italy from Iran (Persia) around 1620. The exact history of the Persian cat does seem to be a bit of a mystery but many of these long-haired cats were seen in hieroglyphics. The story has it that these long-haired cats were then imported into Europe as their popularity grew and breeding took place in Italy and France.</p>

				<h2>Sphynx cat</h2>
				<p>The Sphynx cat is a breed of cat known for its lack of coat (fur). The Sphynx was developed through selective breeding, starting in the 1960s. The skin should have the texture of chamois, as it has fine hairs. Whiskers may be present, either whole or broken, or may be totally absent. Their skin is the color that their fur would be, and all the usual cat markings (solid, point, van, tabby, tortie, etc.) may be found on Sphynx skin. Because they have no coat, they lose more body heat than coated cats. This makes them warm to the touch as well as heat-seeking.</p>

				<h2>American Shorthair</h2>
				<p>The American Shorthair (ASH) is a breed of domestic cat believed to be descended from European cats brought to North America by early settlers to protect valuable cargo from mice and rats. According to the Cat Fancier's Association, in 2012, it was the seventh most popular breed of cat in the United States.</p>

				<h2>Cat</h2>
				
				<p>The domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus or Felis catus) is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards.

Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and a better sense of smell than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting), as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body language.</p>

					<h4>ปรับนิสัยแมวให้กินอาหารเม็ด</h4>
					<p>ถ้าคุณเลี้ยงแมวด้วยอาหารปรุงเองอยู่ให้เริ่มเปลี่ยนมาเป็นให้อาหารกระป๋อง ซึ่งโดยมากมักไม่มีปัญหา แล้วนำอาหารกระป๋องคลุกกับอาหารเม็ด แมวได้กลิ่นอาหารกระป๋องก็จะกินอาหารเม็ดที่เราคลุกไว้ แล้วลดปริมาณอาหารกระป๋องที่เราผสมลงเรื่อยๆ ในเวลาไม่นานแมวก็จะกินอาหารเม็ดได้เอง</p>
